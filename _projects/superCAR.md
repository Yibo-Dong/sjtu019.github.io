Together with Yechuan Xia, we implemented a model checker portfolio, parallel running different variants containing optimizations proposed before, and took part in the AIGER track in the [HWMCC competition this year](https://hwmcc.github.io/2024/).

SuperCAR **won a bronze medal** in the AIGER track this year!
