Together with Yicong Xu, Wenjing Deng, we implemented a HWMC problem generator AIGROW.

**AIGROW** is a novel framework for generating compact yet challenging hardware model checking (HWMC) benchmarks.  
Traditional benchmark sets (e.g., HWMCC) are large and complex, making it difficult to diagnose why model checkers differ in performance. Existing generators such as **AIGFUZZ** and **AIGEN** often produce either trivial or overly large problems, limiting their diagnostic value.

AIGROW addresses these issues with a **runtime-guided generation process**:
- Uses solving time and safety status as feedback to evolve problems.
- Produces **small circuits (often <250 components)** that remain hard to solve.
- Selectively retains cases that expose **performance differences** among checkers.

### Key Contributions
- Benchmarks up to **100× smaller** than those from existing tools while remaining equally challenging.  
- Enabled the diagnosis of inefficiencies in state-of-the-art CAR-based checkers.  
- Led to **concrete optimizations**, including solving **18 previously unsolved HWMCC’24 problems**.  
- Demonstrated how tiny generated problems can reveal **algorithmic weaknesses** and inspire breakthroughs.
