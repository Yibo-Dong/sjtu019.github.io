Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

## About Me

I'm currently a master student in Software Engineering Institute at [East China Normal University(ECNU)](http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/seien/33265/list.htm) since 2022, advised by Prof. [Geguang Pu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/pgg/main.psp) and Prof. [Jianwen Li](https://lijwen2748.github.io/). 

My current research interests revolve around solving real challenges using **formal verification** techniques, with a particular focus on **model checking** and **SAT**. At present, I am deeply engaged in the development of [Complementary Approximate Reachability(CAR)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8203765), a cutting-edge safety model checking algorithm. This involves not only refining the algorithm but also creating novel implementations and applying it to real-world problem-solving. 

Before joining ECNU, I spent my undergraduate time at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I worked around compiler correctness and mathematical logic in Coq, the proof assistant, under supervision of Prof. [Qinxiang Cao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html).

I will join [National University of Singapore(NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg) and work under Prof.[Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/) soon in 2025 fall.
