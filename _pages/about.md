<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at the [TEST-Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) in the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). My research focuses on improving reliability through **testing** and **formal verification** techniques.  

Before joining NUS, I completed my Master’s degree in Software Engineering at [East China Normal University (ECNU)](http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/seien/33265/list.htm), advised by Prof. [Geguang Pu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/pgg/main.psp) and Prof. [Jianwen Li](https://lijwen2748.github.io/), where I worked on hardware model checking. I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I studied compiler correctness and formal reasoning in the Coq proof assistant under Prof. [Qinxiang Cao](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html).
